Ads Boomerang was an idea for a self-service SaaS platform for small ecommerce stores that would deliver advertising focused on driving more sales. This included a script to be inserted onto the client's store, a dashboard to upload ads, an integration with an ad-providing platform (Beeswax), and reporting.

#### What went well
From a technical perspective, most of the bits worked as expected; specifically:

* Integration with Shopify made setup easy

* Integration with Beeswax PaaS provided the ability to buy ads on a variety of ad exchanges

* Dashboard accepted uploads for most standard image formats (300x250, 728x90, 160x600, etc.)

#### Why didn't it work?
The main issue is that there was too much support and explanation required versus the target client's budget:

* most small store owners weren't very tech-savvy, so had to be explained the benefits of retargeting.

* Store owners needed ads designed.

* some store owners were skeptical of online ads generally: many small sellers didn't want to be the type of business that advertised.

* Retargeted ads are cheap, but limited to a site's existing pool of users. This capped the amount that a given client could spend on retargeted ads.

* Non-retargeted ads are totally ineffective without huge amounts of data. Given the amount of fraud/non-viewable ad inventory on most ad-exchanges, buying without extensive data brings zero return.
